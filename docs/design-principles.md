## Why do we need a common set of Design Principles?

### Educate

Design Principles help establish a framework for decision making, providing guidance about the right direction. By understanding the principles designers and developers will have a better understanding about how to solve design problems and create compelling applications.

### Clarify design decisions

Ensure that better decisions are made in a project by using the Design Principles as a framework for decision making. With the backing of these principles, the final product becomes more defensible both within the company as well as to partners and customers.

### Align company-wide design

Design Principles give the team a common, known set of guidelines to work against, to measure and evaluate any design decisions made. Invaluable at the start of a project, these principles will also help throughout the entire development life-cycle, keeping a project unified in it’s look and feel from start to finish.

# Balance is the key to building a successful product

It’s important to remember that the _perfect_ solution does not exist. To avoid straying too far towards any single design principle, it is always necessary to make trade-offs when making design decisions. Inevitably, this process involves testing and iterating many different solutions until a balanced solution is found.

## The Principles

## Effective

Empower people to complete their tasks quickly and efficiently in order to solve their unique business problems.

### How do we design effective products?

The most important thing to remember when designing a useful product, is that we are designing for real people. Focus on the tasks that the user needs to complete. Research their
problems, focus on building a product that solves those problems and empathize with them.

By optimizing for the most common use cases and making the flow quick and efficient, user
satisfaction and productivity will increase. We can accommodate edge cases, but we don’t need to optimize the user flow for them. The goal is to ensure the tasks that get done 80% of the time are the easiest to do, and we can ensure things don’t break for the remaining 20%. Elegant solutions are not always necessary.

### Iterate & test

Testing is the best way to evaluate solutions before putting software in the hands of customers. Testing with 3-5 users [\*](#why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users--jakob-nielsen) is all that’s needed to find the vast majority of usability issues.

Making adjustments based on the testing feedback and then performing another round of testing with those changes will rapidly improve the success, engagement, satisfaction and trust that customers have in our applications.

Testing with real users is the ideal way to get results, but even testing internally, with other staff, is far better than doing no testing at all.

## Inclusive

Build products that enable anyone to be successful using them, no matter what language they speak, device they use, or disabilities they may have.

### How do we make inclusive products?

Standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) specify principles regarding keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast. Adherence to these standards
would help improve the accessibility and usability of our products. Support for localization such as right-to-left (RTL) layouts or text translation will result in more adaptable products, which opens up the global markets for our products. We need to continue to work on ensuring all our products are responsive and adaptable to any screen size or platform to ensure our products can be used on any computer, browser, or phone. We can leverage measurable and testable metrics to ensure our products are as inclusive as we can make them.

### Start with the hardest problems

A solution that includes good accessibility almost always leads to a solution with good usability. It is much easier to make an accessible solution aesthetically pleasing, rather than trying to make a “pretty” design accessible. When the product is to be used on a variety of screen sizes such as phones or tablets, begin with a solution that works well on the smallest screen first and build up from there. It is more difficult to remove functionality from a large screen feature to accommodate a small screen. Solving customer’s core problems with an accessible application that works on smaller screens will provide an immense amount of value to customer.

## Polished

Provide products that are professional, aesthetically pleasing, and as intuitive as possible.

### What is a polished product?

While aesthetics are very subjective, we must try to find a balance the majority of users will find visually appealing. We need to keep in mind we can’t make everyone happy, but we can make sure designs adhere to sound design principles[\*\*](#visual-design-elements-and-principles).

We can ensure the fit and finish of our products is professional and matches our branding. Details such as alignment, spacing, sizing, colors, etc., are checked for consistency, then we will build trust with users by showing we care about the products we build.

### Maintaining the polish

When we evaluate a new design solution, we need to ensure there is reasonable justification for visual styling beyond, “I think it looks good”, or “I prefer it this way”. Removing personal opinions, and basing decisions on user tested and vetted solutions, allows us to deliver a solid product.

We can save time by leveraging existing patterns as much as possible. Many of our products will have already established certain types of patterns or input controls that can be reused for new feature and product development.

When starting on a new design task, we need to ask ourselves “what have we already built that is similar to this and can we use any of it to solve our current problem?”

## Cohesive

Ensure every product we produce is recognizable to customers as being a VertiGIS product.

### How do we create and maintain consistency?

Use the same visual language throughout our products. This is important to maintain consistency. For example, using a trash can icon for delete actions, or using the same form label and text input alignment across all products. Consistency promotes a sense of familiarity and trust in our users.

Follow a defined set of guidelines for iconography, complex interactions, form layouts, button styling, component states, typography language strings and more. This ensures that user interactions are predictable from one product to another.

### The foundation for consistency is communication

We need to consider how changes will impact other products and ensure the product teams are consulted before implementing crossproduct changes.

We must gather input from the other product teams early in the brainstorming process, so that any changes can be made at that point, and not after decisions have been finalized.

We must ensure that everyone understands why decisions are being made, and make any accommodations for other products as needed. Having everyone on board with design solutions
provides everyone involved with a sense of ownership in the final product.

Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources. The best results come from testing no more than 5 users
and running as many small tests as you can afford.
