## Whitespace/Padding

There should be consistent padding of 10 pixels between elements. Examples of this include the space between an icon and title, controls and their titles, controls and other controls.

## Buttons

We have various buttons options of differing importance and loudness.

### Default

Standard buttons with the last three being deactivated.

## Form Design

A properly designed form allows people to quickly enter values in a logical order and in a manner that makes sense to them. This requires fields to be flexible when interpreting the user's input.

### Labels

-   Are easily interpreted
-   Located on top of or to the left of most fields
    -   Labels on the top is better for internationalization and long strings
-   Usually appear to the right of check boxes and radio buttons
-   Ensure there is not too much space between the label and it's associated field so that it is clear which field goes with the label

### Fields

-   The length of text fields should suggest the amount of data that should be entered
-   Ensure that there is not too much space between fields so that nothing gets accidentally overlooked.

### Links/Buttons

-   Primary actions should be clear and obvious
-   Secondary actions are for more discrete actions
-   Multi-step and complex forms should have all other navigation removed
    -   Back links should be included for easy corrections in multi-step forms
-   Include a _Cancel_ link to provide a safety net for users to escape the form

### Keyboard Use

-   Do not force users to frequently switch between the keyboard and mouse
-   Correct tab order is set up
-   If possible, avoid drop-down lists where typing is quicker
    -   Auto-complete or auto-suggest is very beneficial

### Be Helpful

-   Be flexible when interpreting the values that users enter
    -   Eg: when entering a phone number, accept both no-spaces and dashes
-   Help users check the information they've entered before submitting
    -   [WCAG 3.3.4](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#error-prevention-legal-financial-data) requires error prevention for legal and financial data so that it is reversible, checked for errors, and confirmed.
-   If possible, provide confirmation or error information where the user's attention is currently via immediate inline feedback
-   If possible, try to avoid multiple columns for form layouts. This increases the likelihood that something in the right column will be missed.
    -   Usability testing <sup>[\[1\]](https://baymard.com/blog/avoid-multi-column-forms) [\[2\]](https://cxl.com/research-study/form-field-usability/)</sup> has shown that multi-column forms do not perform as well as single column layouts.
-   Remove any unnecessary distractions and links that competes with and takes the users attention away from the form they are filling out.

## Icons

### Where can I find the Icons?

Our master repository of icons, consists of over 600 pre-created icons ready for use in our icon package. Instructions on how to install packages can be found in our **<a href="https://developers.geocortex.com/docs/web/sdk-reference-third-party-libraries/#installing-packages" target="_blank">Developer Center</a>**. We store all our icons in this online repository, in several formats (png, svg, pdf). The .svg format icons are comprised of compound paths, black #000000), and an artboard of 24px by 24px. They have been stripped of all unnecessary meta info and optimized using the SVGo optimization script included in the repo.

### How do I use icons in my app?

Instructions for using either built in icons, or your own, can be found in the **<a href="https://developers.geocortex.com/docs/web/sdk-adding-icons/#next-steps" target="_blank">Developer Center</a>**.

### How do I create a custom icon?

When creating our icons, simplicity is key. Since we are working with a canvas of only 24px x 24px, every design provided must be concise and communicate the idea clearly, and easily. Fine details are less important than trying to ensure that shapes stay recognizable. Information regarding this process is available in our **<a href="https://developers.geocortex.com/docs/web/sdk-components-styling" target="_blank">Developer Center information</a>**.

#### Style

The visual language of our icons should be consistent, creating a harmonious appearance across all of our products:

-   All icons must be made using a single color (black), with negative space being transparent.
-   When employing linework, trying to maintain at least 2 pixels in width, with an equal amount of white space allows the designs to remain clear when viewed at 100%. This guideline is flexible however, depending on what elements are used.
-   Modifiers must be placed in the bottom right of the icon, with a border of 2px of empty space outlining it.
-   Simplistic, clear, and simple designs are preferable to complicated patterns.
-   The visual loudness of the icon should convey its importance, but not overpower other messages surrounding it, including the written identifier.

## Lists and Menus

Lists come into use in many aspects of our products: Feature Details, Search Results, Building information, and many more. No matter what needs to be displayed, if it falls into a list like quality, then a list should be used. Examples of different utilizations of the list element are below.

### Simple List

![list](/img/list/simple.png "Simple List")

The most straight forward of implementations. This simple list view can include text, or text and icons. Examples of this menu's use include: Action Menus.

### Menu List

![list](/img/list/menu.png "Menu List")

![menus](/img/menus/menu.gif "Menu - Title Only")

![menus](/img/menus/menu-full.png "Menu - Title - Icon - Description")

Menus are used to group additional commands for components that are not worth displaying in a more prominent visual manner, or that simply donâ€™t belong anywhere else in the interface. Menu items consist of a single line of text to indicate what function will be triggered when the item is clicked. The hover state for menu items is built in an identical fashion to those used in list items (See above). A colored bar is added to the left side, and the background receives a gray gradient to white.

### List Controls

![list](/img/list/list-controls.png "List Controls")

### Pinned Subheader List

## ![list](/img/list/pinned-subheader.png "Pinned Subheader List")

## States

A few guidelines should be followed to ensure that the list element looks uniform, and fit within the application properly.

### Hover

![list](/img/list/selected-item.png "Hover Item State")

When a hover state is triggered, it cannot just rely on a colour change. There also must be a state change that shows the differentiation. For example, in our programs, there is a background colour change, as well as the addition of a side border colour. Hover states will must always include a styling change, and the background colour will get a gradient.

### Focus

![list](/img/list/list-focused.png "Focused Item State")

Focus indicators provide an easy way to identify currently active elements, against the rest of the design elements. Focus states must be unique from the hover state to make them distinct when using a keyboard for navigation. Focus states have a triple border design, so that regardless of the background they are implemented on, they will always be visible and easy to identify.

### Selected/Active

![list](/img/list/list-active.png "Active Item State")

Selected and Active states for list elements should showcase similar behaviour to the hover state. They must show that they are currently active, and visually distinct from the rest of the list elements.
